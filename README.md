# FraudDetectionSystem
🛡️ Fraud Detection System Welcome to the Fraud Detection System project! This system is designed to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in a banking or financial context. Built with Java and the Spring Framework, the project lays the foundation for a robust fraud detection solution.

🚀 Project Overview This project is a backend system for detecting fraudulent transactions based on predefined rules. The system is designed with scalability and flexibility in mind, allowing future integration with machine learning models, real-time transaction processing, and alerting mechanisms.

Key Features Rule-Based Fraud Detection: The system uses predefined business rules to flag suspicious transactions. Transaction Monitoring: Monitors transactions within specific timeframes to detect abnormal patterns. Spring Boot Integration: Leveraging the power of the Spring Framework for a modular and maintainable codebase. RESTful API: Exposes endpoints for integrating with other systems or applications.

📂 Project Structure The project follows a standard Spring Boot structure: fraud-detection-system/ ├── src/ │ ├── main/ │ │ ├── java/ │ │ │ └── abdalhaleem.com.FraudDetectionApp/ │ │ │ ├── controller/ # API controllers │ │ │ ├── service/ # Business logic │ │ │ ├── model/ # Data models │ │ │ └── repo/ # Data access layer │ │ ├── resources/ │ │ │ └── application.properties # Configuration files ├── .gitignore ├── pom.xml └── README.md

🛠️ Technology Stack Java 17: The core programming language. Spring Boot 3.3.2: For building the application and handling dependencies. Spring Data JPA: For database interaction. Maven: For project management and build automation.

📋 API Endpoints Transaction Endpoints POST /transactions: Submit a new transaction for fraud analysis. GET /transactions: Retrieve all transactions. GET /transaction/{id}: Retrieve transaction details by ID. PUT /transaction: Update transaction details. DELETE /transaction/{id}: Delete transaction.

POST /transactions Content-Type: application/json

🗓️ Future Improvements The following features are planned for future implementation:

Alert System: Implement an alert system to notify users or administrators of potentially fraudulent activity. Reporting and Analytics: Implement REST APIs for fetching fraud reports and analytics.
